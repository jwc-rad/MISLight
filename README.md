# MISLight
Medical Image Segmentation in Pytorch Lightning
</div>

## Description
**MISLight** is just one of many medical image segmentation implementations out there, yet it aims for readability and reusability in line with the philosophy of [Pytorch Lightning](https://github.com/Lightning-AI/lightning).
- This [branch](https://github.com/jwc-rad/MISLight/tree/flare22) is the official repository for **Knowledge Distillation from Cross Teaching Teachers for Efficient Semi-supervised Abdominal Organ Segmentation in CT**, which was used for the [MICCAI FLARE 2022](https://flare22.grand-challenge.org) challenge.
