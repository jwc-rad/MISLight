# MISLight
Medical Image Segmentation in Pytorch Lightning
</div>

## Description
**MISLight** is just one of many medical image segmentation implementations out there, yet aims for readability and reusability, sharing the very philosophy of [Pytorch Lightning](https://github.com/Lightning-AI/lightning).
- Currently, the actual main brain is this [branch](https://github.com/jwc-rad/MISLight/tree/flare22) used for the [MICCAI FLARE 2022](https://flare22.grand-challenge.org) challenge.
- The "main" branch for general purpose is still being organized.
